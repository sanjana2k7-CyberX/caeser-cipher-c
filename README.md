# Caesar Cipher in C

# Overview
This project implements the classical Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm in C. 
The program shifts alphabetic characters by a user-defined key while preserving uppercase and lowercase letters.

# Features
- Supports uppercase (A–Z) and lowercase (a–z)
- Handles positive and negative shift values
- Uses modular arithmetic for proper wrapping
- Simple console-based interface

# Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- Standard Library (stdio.h)

# How to Compile and Run

Compile:
gcc caesar.c 

Run:
./caesar

# Example

Input:
Enter text: Happy  
Enter shift: 4  

Output:
Encrypted text: Lettc

# Concepts Demonstrated
- String manipulation
- ASCII character handling
- Loops and conditionals
